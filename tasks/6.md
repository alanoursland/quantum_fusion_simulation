### Task Plan: SimulationRunner Module

#### **Objective:**
Enhance the SimulationRunner module to support adaptive simulation techniques, batch simulations, and dynamic stopping conditions.

#### **Current Status:**
- Runs a fixed 100 iterations of the simulation loop with detailed logging.

#### **Planned Enhancements:**
1. **Adaptive Simulation Techniques:**
   - Implement logic to adjust simulation parameters dynamically based on intermediate results.
   - Introduce feedback loops where simulation outcomes guide future iterations.

2. **Batch Simulation Support:**
   - Enable running multiple simulations in parallel with varying parameters.
   - Add functionality to aggregate results from batch runs for statistical analysis.

3. **Dynamic Stopping Conditions:**
   - Introduce criteria for stopping simulations early if fusion probability converges.
   - Avoid unnecessary computation by detecting stable simulation states.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Update `SimulationRunner` Class:**
   - Implement adaptive parameter management and batch processing methods.
   - Develop stopping condition logic that evaluates simulation progress.

2. **Testing:**
   - Create tests for adaptive behavior under different simulation scenarios.
   - Test batch simulation execution and result aggregation.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Provide usage examples and explain how to set adaptive and batch processing configurations.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
- More efficient simulation runs with the ability to explore a wide range of parameters.
- Reduction in computational overhead through adaptive techniques and early stopping.

#### **Timeline:**
- **Implementation:** 3 days
- **Testing:** 2 days
- **Documentation:** 1 day
