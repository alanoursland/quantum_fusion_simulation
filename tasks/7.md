### Task Plan: DataHandler Module

#### **Objective:**
Enhance the DataHandler module to support advanced data storage, visualization of quantum state evolution, and comparative analysis of simulation runs.

#### **Current Status:**
- Saves simulation results to JSON and provides basic text-based visualization.

#### **Planned Enhancements:**
1. **Data Storage Improvements:**
   - Extend the data model to include metadata such as simulation parameters and quantum state histories.
   - Introduce support for storing data in more structured formats like HDF5 for better scalability.

2. **Advanced Visualization Techniques:**
   - Develop visualization tools for quantum state evolution, including wavefunction plots and probability distributions.
   - Implement interactive visualizations that help analyze simulation data more effectively.

3. **Comparative Analysis Tools:**
   - Add features to compare results from different simulation runs.
   - Provide statistical tools to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in simulation outcomes.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Update `DataHandler` Class:**
   - Introduce advanced data storage methods and visualization techniques.
   - Implement tools for comparing and analyzing data from batch simulations.

2. **Testing:**
   - Develop tests for data integrity, ensuring that stored data accurately reflects simulation states.
   - Test visualization outputs for accuracy and clarity.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Provide detailed guides on how to store, visualize, and analyze simulation data.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
- More informative and visually rich representations of quantum state dynamics.
- Enhanced ability to draw insights from large sets of simulation data.

#### **Timeline:**
- **Implementation:** 3 days
- **Testing:** 2 days
- **Documentation:** 1 day
