### Task Plan: QuantumState Module

#### **Objective:**
Implement realistic quantum state preparation for hydrogen ions, including support for superposition and mixed states using density matrices.

#### **Current Status:**
- Initializes quantum states for hydrogen ions with a basic state vector.
- Lacks physical wavefunctions and advanced quantum state representations.

#### **Planned Enhancements:**
1. **Realistic Wavefunction Initialization:**
   - Develop wavefunctions representing hydrogen ions in terms of position, momentum, and energy states.
   - Implement physical models, possibly using known solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for hydrogen atoms.

2. **Quantum Superposition and Mixed States:**
   - Introduce density matrix representation to support mixed quantum states.
   - Provide methods to create superposition states programmatically.

3. **State Preparation Techniques:**
   - Implement methods for state preparation based on specific physical conditions (e.g., ion energy levels).

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Update `QuantumState` Class:**
   - Add methods for setting wavefunctions as initial states.
   - Implement density matrix handling and superposition creation.

2. **Testing:**
   - Develop unit tests to validate wavefunction accuracy and mixed state behavior.
   - Compare generated states with theoretical predictions for hydrogen atoms.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update documentation with examples of how to initialize and manipulate quantum states.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
- Quantum states initialized with realistic physical properties.
- Support for complex quantum phenomena like superposition and mixed states.

#### **Timeline:**
- **Implementation:** 3 days
- **Testing:** 2 days
- **Documentation:** 1 day
