### Task Plan: QuantumOperations Module

#### **Objective:**
Implement advanced quantum gate operations and entanglement mechanics to enable meaningful manipulation of particle wavefunctions.

#### **Current Status:**
- The module provides basic placeholder logic for superposition, phase shift, and entanglement.

#### **Planned Enhancements:**
1. **Quantum Gate Implementation:**
   - Develop mathematical models for quantum gates (e.g., Pauli, Hadamard, CNOT) that manipulate state vectors.
   - Introduce parameterized gates for dynamic phase shifts and rotations.

2. **Refined Entanglement Mechanics:**
   - Implement robust entanglement operations that correctly correlate quantum states.
   - Add support for multi-qubit entanglement and Bell state creation.

3. **Advanced Quantum Operations:**
   - Explore non-standard quantum operations that may influence the Coulomb barrier.
   - Provide interfaces for custom operation definitions by researchers.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Update `QuantumOperations` Class:**
   - Replace placeholder logic with functional quantum gate models.
   - Implement entanglement methods that handle complex quantum correlations.

2. **Testing:**
   - Create unit tests to verify the effects of each quantum operation on test state vectors.
   - Develop scenarios that validate entanglement by testing measurement correlations.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Include detailed explanations of available quantum operations, usage examples, and expected outcomes.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
- Functional and accurate quantum operations that modify quantum states in a controlled manner.
- Ability to create entangled states and explore quantum mechanical effects in simulations.

#### **Timeline:**
- **Implementation:** 3 days
- **Testing:** 2 days
- **Documentation:** 1 day
